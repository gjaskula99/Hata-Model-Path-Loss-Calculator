# Hata-Model-Path-Loss-Calculator
Path loss calculator based on Hata Model.

The Hata model is a radio propagation model for predicting the path loss of cellular transmissions in exterior environments, valid for microwave frequencies from 150 to 1500 MHz. It is an empirical formulation based on the data from the Okumura model, and is thus also commonly referred to as the Okumuraâ€“Hata model. The model incorporates the graphical information from Okumura model and develops it further to realize the effects of diffraction, reflection and scattering caused by city structures. Additionally, the Hata Model applies corrections for applications in suburban and rural environments.

Calculator takes values of frequency, distance between receivers, BTS and mobile terminal height and calculates path loss in dB.
